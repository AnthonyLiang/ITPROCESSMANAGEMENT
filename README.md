Why is version / source control important?

  Version/Source Control is important because it allows an IT Process Management team to keep track of updates in an organized and non-intruding manner. Having a Version/Source Control system such as GIT and using Github as a platform allows multiple users to work on code at the same time through each of his or her own branch and in completely different environments. If the desired results are completed, then they would be able they commit and push their work into the team's master branch. If not, then they can revert back to any previous versions to disperse any conflicts and errors. Every commit is tracked and organized in a way that can also be used for documentation. The master branch/version would contain the team's optimal model of the code as well as provide checkpoints(versions) for continuing on or going back. Finally, having this type of system would allow each user in the team to provide due diligence and making sure that they are completing what they claimed to do. Version / source control is a great tool for SDLC teams that want to efficiently collaborate simulataneously and making sure that there is a safety net to lean back on.
