Why is version / source control important?

  Version/Source Control is important because it allows an IT Process Management team keep track of updates in an organized and non-intruding manner. Having a Version/Source Control such as GIT and using Github as a platform allows multiple users to work on code at the same time through each of his or her own branch. If the desired results are completed, then they would be able they commit and push their work into the team's master branch. Coding this way would mean that any conflicts and errors can be reversed and tracked.The master branch would contain the team's optimal model of the code as well and provide checkpoints(versions) for continuing on. Finally, having this type of system would allow each user in the team to provide due diligence and making sure that they are carrying their own weight.
